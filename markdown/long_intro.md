## Hi, I'm Gracie!

### About: the long story. 

I don't think anyone knows or even remembers this movie, but back in middle school, my first introduction to tech was *The Internship*. It was this trashy comedy about a two wacky funny crazy goofball friends who somehow scammed their way to Google (the most absurd plot; I should watch it again someday). What I can recall most distinctly was this giant red slide that they had in an already lavish office, and at ten years old, when I thought every adult was stuffy and boring and sad, this was so very intriguing. 

A few years later, as a senior in high school, I ended up applying to every college as a Chemistry major, of all things. My freshman year at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/) was pretty miserable. And guess what! Gen Chem kicked my ass. So did Problems in Philosophy, which was jarring because I genuinely thought I had a future in introspection (instead, I couldn't even grasp Descarte's whole candle argument). Things were all lopsided and I had no clue what I wanted to do or pursue. 

I don't remember much from my first semester, nevertheless the timeline of things. At some point I decided to switch into Computational Biology. I joined a prehealth fraternity (even though, at no point ever did I think I was going to go to medical school). Experiencing college during a global pandemic meant I was pretty much desperate for friends, and a fraternity, with its promise of brotherhood, seemed to be a good way to go about it.

This entire time I had a Computer Science double major under my belt. I thoroughly enjoyed my Introduction to Computer Science course, which I took my second semester. 

When sophomore year came around, I was fully committed to a Computational Biology degree. There was a level of delusion going on---had to be---as I could not hate my Biology class more. The only courses I looked forward to where Elementary to Intermediate Statistics and Data Analysis and Introduction to Computer Engineering. Also Introduction to Psychology, but mostly so I could confirm my neuroticism with every lecture. 

It was also my first semester TAing Introduction to Computer Science, and something I looked forward to so much that it felt irrational. I picked up extra shifts whenever I could. There was something so satisfying about explaining a concept clearly enough for someone to finally understand it. I also craved the community of TAs that came along with it. I felt, for the first time, that I was among people that I could relate to in some way. Their interest in the subject paralleled my own, which I couldn't seem to find in the prehealth frat. 

At the end of the semester I told my mom that I wanted to change my major entirely. I dropped the fraternity. When I registered for classes, I was finally excited about what I was going to take. 

I thought things would be easier from here. But I felt underqualified compared to my peers, especially those who knew from the start that they wanted to do Computer Science. Now I was playing catchup, as always, three steps behind. Somehow this felt worse than not knowing anything at all, and I'll be so honest, I genuinely think I blacked out my second semester sophomore year. I don't remember anything at all, more so than first semester of college (concerning trend, but promise it gets better; and I'm generally just forgetful).

Somehow, after a rejection from a fellowship run by a local CRM company that stung pretty bad, I ended up in a [Systems Biology research lab](https://hengenlab.org/) over the summer. I had taken Introduction to Data Science the previous semester and thought it was pretty interesting. This was the first time I coded something outside of class, using knowledge that I learned in class, for something substantial and meaningful. Staying in St. Louis for a straight seven months definitely did something to my psyche, though. 

Spending some time in a lab environment made me reflect on the plans I had had just a year before. I thought I was going to go to graduate school and waste years doing whatever Chemistry PhDs did. As if this was ever feasible or entincing in the first place. Not to bag on PhDs or graduate school or working in labs. I gained an immense amount of respect for how much passion and knowledge it takes to pursue academia, passion and knowledge I don't think I could ever muster up. But compared to that future, the one I was now forging for myself seemed so much more tangible and grounded in reality. 

I gained a lot of confidence in the Hengen Lab. In my junior fall, my courseload was now almost all CS and HCI related. I attended Grace Hopper in late September with a few friends I met because of my major switch. It was astonishing to see the tech industry in action and the effort that was being put in to diversify it. I'd never seen anything like it. 

Cue the internship frenzy that followed. I knew that the internship before new grad was especially important, and the catchup was intensifying exponentionally. I had been dissed at Grace Hopper, where two different recruiters at two different companies looked at my resume and asked me if I had never had an internship before. I didn't blame them. I had very little credibility. 

*And my Leetcode stats were shit!* Yes, I did join *r/CSMajors*. In high school it was *r/ApplyingToCollege*, and I guess very little changes about the obsessive.

Applying to tens of internships and beating myself up for doing it so late and chugging oat milk lattes and bawling my eyes out and doing one Leetcode problem and sleep was daily routine. I was beyond stressed about my future, worried beyond belief that I was unemployable. My first technical interview was a disaster and left me berated by both my interviewer and myself. I cried on the phone to my school's mental health hotline, feeling like I had bored my friends with the same worries over and over again. Things were looking dire, at least to my small little walnut brain at the time. 

Tides began to turn in early November, and a company that I didn't give much thought to throughout the entire interview process, from OA to behaviorial to technical, ended up extending me an offer along with a bank. Between JP Morgan Chase and Expedia Group, I chose the latter. Other companies began reaching out for final rounds, but by then I was so exhausted by the entire endeavor. 

Now I'm back home, excited to get my bearings together after a demanding but ultimately, rewarding semester. I'm excited to see what the next few months bring, and am so extremely excited to be in Austin working on actual features for actual consumers.
